# ResearchAI Platform: 2-Minute Faculty Demo Script

## Live Demonstration [90 seconds]

### Opening Demo [30 seconds]
**"Let me demonstrate ResearchAI - an AI research assistant that revolutionizes how we discover and analyze literature."**

*[Open localhost:5174, type "deep learning in drug discovery"]*

**"Watch this live search across five databases simultaneously - Google Scholar, PubMed, ArXiv, OpenAlex, and Unpaywall. In seconds, we're getting 40+ relevant papers."**

*[Show real-time results appearing]*

**"Notice the comprehensive coverage - from medical journals to computer science conferences."**

### Interactive Analysis Demo [30 seconds]
**"Now here's the breakthrough feature - intelligent paper analysis. I'll tag this paper on neural networks..."**

*[Click @ symbol, tag a paper]*

**"And ask: 'What is the novel methodology proposed in this research?'"**

*[Type question, show AI response]*

**"The system reads the full paper content and provides contextual answers - not just abstract summaries. This is our RAG system maintaining paper context across the entire session."**

### Auto-Presentation Demo [30 seconds]
**"Finally, automated presentation generation. Let me upload this research PDF..."**

*[Navigate to Auto-PPT tab, drag and drop PDF]*

**"Watch as it extracts the paper structure, generates multiple slides with methodology, results, and conclusions."**

*[Show theme selection - Academic, Modern, Corporate]*

**"Professional themes ready for conferences. What took hours now takes minutes."**

## Future Research & Development [30 seconds]
**"Looking ahead, we're implementing three game-changing features for publication:**

**1. AI Research Hypothesis Generator - automatically suggests testable research directions from gap analysis**
**2. Cross-domain insight discovery - finding hidden connections between different research fields**  
**3. Collaborative research workspaces for team-based literature reviews**

**We're targeting publication in CHI 2025 and CSCW 2025, with plans for commercialization through university partnerships.**

**This platform represents the future of AI-assisted research. Questions?"**
